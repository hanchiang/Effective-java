/**
 * Providing a static factory method instead of a public constructor has both advantages and
 * disadvantages.
 *  + Static factory with a well-chosen name is easier to use and the resulting client code easier to read.
 *  + Unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked.
 *    The ability of static factory methods to return the same object from repeated invocations allows
 *    classes to maintain strict control over what instances exist at any time.
 *  + Unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
 *    --> Encapsulation
 *  - Classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed. This encourages composition instead of inheritance.
 *  - Hard to find, because they don't stand out in the sea of API documentations.
